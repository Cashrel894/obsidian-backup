General guidelines:
- Don't Repeat Yourself; Use existing implementations
- Look up attributes on instances whenever possible (instead of their classes)

Inheritance vs Composition: (Composition 指将一个对象作为另一个对象的属性)
- Inheritance: "is-a". Minecraft **is a** kind of game.
- Composition: "has-a". Minecraft **has a** lot of kinds of blocks.
