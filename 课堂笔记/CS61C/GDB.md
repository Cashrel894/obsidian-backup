#CS61C 
> GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on 'inside' another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed.
> GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of these) to help you catch bugs in the act:
	- Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.
	- Make your program stop on specified conditions.
	- Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
	- Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.
