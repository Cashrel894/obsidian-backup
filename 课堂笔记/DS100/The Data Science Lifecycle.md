### Ask a question
- What problems are we trying to solve?
    - The goal of asking a question should be clear in order to justify your efforts to stakeholders.
- What are the hypotheses we want to test?
    - This gives a clear perspective from which to analyze final results.
- What are the metrics for our success?
    - This establishes a clear point to know when to conclude the project.

### Obtain Data
- What data do we have, and what data do we need?
    - Define the units of the data (people, cities, points in time, etc.) and what features to measure.
- How can we sample more data?
    - Scrape the web, collect manually, run experiments, etc.
- Is our data representative of the population we want to study?
    - If our data is not representative of our population of interest, then we can come to incorrect conclusions.

关键步骤：**数据收集**、**数据清洗**

### Understand the Data
- How is our data organized, and what does it contain?
    - Knowing what the data says about the world helps us better understand the world.
- Do we have relevant data?
    - If the data we have collected is not useful to the question at hand, then we must collect more data.
- What are the biases, anomalies, or other issues with the data?
    - These can lead to many false conclusions if ignored, so data scientists must always be aware of these issues.
- How do we transform the data to enable effective analysis?
    - Data is not always easy to interpret at first glance, so a data scientist should strive to reveal the hidden insights.

关键步骤：**探索性数据分析**、**数据可视化**

### Understand the World
- What does the data say about the world?
    - Given our models, the data will lead us to certain conclusions about the real world.  
- Does it answer our questions or accurately solve the problem?
    - If our model and data can not accomplish our goals, then we must reform our question, model, or both.  
- How robust are our conclusions and can we trust the predictions?
    - Inaccurate models can lead to false conclusions.
