## The goals of 6.102
Our primary goal in this course is learning how to produce software that is:
- **Safe from bugs**. Correctness (correct behavior right now) and defensiveness (correct behavior in the future) are required in any software we build.
- **Easy to understand**. The code has to communicate to future programmers who need to understand it and make changes in it (fixing bugs or adding new features). That future programmer might be you, months or years from now. You’ll be surprised how much you forget if you don’t write it down, and how much it helps your own future self to have a good design.
- **Ready for change**. Software always changes. Some designs make it easy to make changes; others require throwing away and rewriting a lot of code.
